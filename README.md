SUPER OVERPOWERED
do not overdupe, I'd say the upper limit is around 30B a day.
Steps:
Put an item in a chest; preferably a topaz gemstone or something idfk.
Second, packet dupe inside a minion gui. The mod has a tutorial gui. 
Once the server is crashed, go back to your chest, there should be a copy of the item in your chest and in your inventory.
AFTER THIS WAIT 20 MINUTES WITH BOTH ITEMS IN THE CHEST DO NOT SWITCH LOBBIES
If you follow this, theres a very low ban rate.
If you have pizza client installed while using this mod, dont; it will probably insta ban you\
Enjoy, and don't overdupe!
